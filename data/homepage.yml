  title: "Who am I?"
  content: 
    <p class="lead">
    <strong>I love helping data scientists.</strong> My passion is training. But, when I am not making new courses
    or building software, I enjoy vacationing with my family and friends. 
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    <strong>My area of focus</strong> is applying data science to business. 
    I create value for companies by understanding the financial
    cost of problems and delivering a return-on-investment with my solutions. 
    I enjoy learning, working with stakeholders, and making better decisions with data.
